# ReviewsAnalysis


# Set up

Ensure you have your AWS and your credentials on hand, then run:

```
AWS_PROFILE=YOUR_AWS_PROFILE AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=YOUR_AWS_REGION go run cmd/scratch/main.go
```

After a while, a JSON file for the result with sentiment analysis will be store at **./data/scratch_top10_project_comments_XXX.json**.

Happy hacking!
